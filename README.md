# RopeDataPack
Allows you to string a lead between two fence posts using the new rope tool! (Any resemblance between the rope tool and a renamed carrot on a stick is strictly coincidental).

How do I create a rope tool?
 - Either craft one from a single lead,
 - or use the command `/function rope:give_rope`
 
How do I use the rope tool?
 - With the rope tool equipped, right click a fence post. A knot should appear that starts to sparkle.
 - Right click another fence post. The first fence post should no longer be sparkling, and a rope should be strung between the two fenceposts.

Why is it so difficult to add another rope to a fence that already has one?
 - Blame the invisible cows. Seriously. You can't actually rope two fences together, so there's an invisible cow holding one end of the rope.
 - It's easier to attach the rope from the top of the fence post.

My ropes disappeared!
 - Something bad probably happened to your invisible cows. Sorry.

How do I get rid of these ropes and cows?
 - Break the knots or the fence posts. The ropes and cows will disappear.

I didn't mean to click that fence, and now it's all sparkly!
 - Click it again, the sparkles and knot will go away.

How do I get rid of the entire datapack?
 - `/function rope:uninstall`
